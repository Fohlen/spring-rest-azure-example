The `public` folder contains all files that belong to the front-end.

### Install the front-end
[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) is used to manage dependencies, since it does contain most of everything and is very easy to use.
Please make sure that the following dependency is met:

- Node.js >= 6.10.3

Simply go by `npm install`, and `npm start` and the website should be at your fingertips.

### Packages used
Currently the following packages are used:

- [Bootstrap 4](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/)
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [Tether](http://tether.io/)

### Simple example
The simple example allows hitting a sample against the REST service.
Since the site is served via [browser-sync](https://www.browsersync.io/), just modify [index.html](/public/index.html), and get your results instantly.
